# WordPress Trash Notice
Plugin for WordPress that adds a notice in dashboard about WordPress automatically removing trashed posts after 30 days. Helpful for developers with lots of clients and sites with lots of editors.

It adds the notice to the message that appear when you rrash an item and also shows the notice on the trashed post table. It works with all custom post types and pages as well. It also check if you have chnaged the number of days posts are deleted from trash.

I created this plugin after a client complained that she didnt know that WordPres would automatically delete the post.

You can find it on [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/trash-notice/).
